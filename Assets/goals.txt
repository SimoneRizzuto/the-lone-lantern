CUTSCENE GOALS:
Sound effects,
Cutscene triggers,
Player interaction is locked when cutscene begins

GOALS:
- Luce gets locked when in a cutscene,
- a cutscene that involves movement of multiple objects with their animations,
- depth exist when moving Luce,
- interaction with objects as Luce,
- add visual objects to the rooms and see how the artstyle is going to look

- clean up movement code for the Player: methods and interfaces for specific things maybe,
(subgoal: start setting up rebindable keys)
